## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Yuksel, just your neighbourly software engineer.

ðŸ”­ I spend majority of my time creating software that pipelines data,
and the most of my free time writing software on new frameworks/frameworks that are new to me.

ðŸ¤” You will probably see a whole bunch of forked/experimented repositories, but don't get overwhelmed. If you need a little bit
more guidance, do check out my [website](https://yukselyonsel.com/), I try to explain most of the newer/main stuff that I work(ed) on over there.
